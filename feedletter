# We use runLocal rather than runMain, because the edit-subscription subcommand
# requires access to unmediated standard input, and runMain often fakes / forwards
# it.
#
# It might be better to write a custom run command that forks the process but
# always inherits parent streams. But we'll stick with in-process execution for
# now.
